1. Suppose that coverage criterion C1 subsumes coverage criterion C2. Further suppose that test set T1 satisfies C1 on program P, and test set  T2 satisfies C2, also on P.

(a) Does T1 necessarily satisfy C2? Explain.

- Yes. This follows directly from the definition of subsumption.

(b) Does T2 necessarily satisfy C1? Explain.
-
No. There is no reason to expect test requirements generated by C1 to be satisfied by T2.

(c) If P contains a fault, and T2 reveals the fault, T1 does not necessarily also reveal the fault. Explain.

-No, subsumption is about criteria, not about test sets. In particular, there is no requirement that test set T2 be a subset of test set T1. So, it could happen that T2 contains that one test that reveals the fault, and T1 doesn't.

2. How else could we compare test criteria besides subsumption?

Criteria vs subsumption • Criteria subsumption : A test criterion C1 subsumes C2 if and only if every set of test cases that satisfies criterion C1 also satisfies C2 
• Must be true for every set of test cases 
• Example: color criteria for the jelly bean: {yellow, green, orange, white} 
• If we satisfy flavor criteria, we’ll satisfy color criteria
